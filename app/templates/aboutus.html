            <h2>Future Work on Shark Attacks</h2>
            <p>Analyze Shark Species: Investigate which shark species are most commonly involved in attacks. This includes examining attack frequency by species to identify patterns and trends.</p>
            <p>Find Fatality Data for Bears: Seek out additional data on fatal bear attacks to understand fatality rates. This involves finding sources or datasets that provide detailed information on fatal incidents involving bears.</p>
            <p>Note: Both datasets had individual records for each type of attack, but we were limited by the absence of matching fields in the CSV files. This discrepancy impacted our ability to directly compare and analyze fatality rates across both datasets.</p>

            <h2>Biases and Limitations</h2>
            <p>In analyzing bear attack incidents, several biases may affect the dataset. Severe or fatal attacks are more likely to be reported, while minor incidents often go unrecorded. This reporting bias skews the data toward more extreme cases, with survivor bias further contributing by underrepresenting non-fatal encounters. Additionally, the data is geographically concentrated, limiting broader insights across regions. There is also the possibility of human error due to manual data entry, which could introduce inaccuracies.</p>
            <p>The analysis is further constrained by certain limitations. Some incidents have incomplete data, missing key details such as dates, locations, or the circumstances surrounding the attacks. The dataset also includes older records that may lack consistency or detail compared to recent entries. Variability in data formats across sources necessitates standardization efforts, adding complexity to the analysis. Additionally, the dataset does not provide enough information to establish direct causes of bear attacks. Finally, the focus on polar bear attacks limits the ability to generalize findings to other species.</p>
