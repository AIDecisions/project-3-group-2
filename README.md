Shark and Bear Attacks?
Our project aimed to bridge the gap between dramatic cinematic portrayals of wildlife encounters, such as those seen in "Jaws" and "The Revenant," and the real-world data on bear and shark attacks. Driven by a passion for nature and wildlife, we set out to analyze actual attack data to understand the frequency, conditions, and characteristics of these encounters. Our work involved several key phases: establishing a robust database and backend using SQLite and SQLAlchemy, developing a Flask application with API endpoints for data interaction, and conducting thorough data analysis to generate insights. We then created interactive visualizations and integrated them into a user-friendly frontend with HTML templates. The project culminated in rigorous testing, deployment to a cloud platform, and preparation for a comprehensive presentation of our findings. Through this process, we aimed to provide a data-driven perspective on wildlife interactions, moving beyond sensationalized narratives to offer valuable insights into animal behavior and human safety.
